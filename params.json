{"name":"Viper","tagline":"Interactive realtime image processing system using Processing Language","body":"## Video Performance System\r\nViper is an interactive realtime image processing system developed using the Processing language and environment. It includes support for multiple channel image/video processing through OSC instructions to the Viper server. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Sample Instructions\r\nTo place an image:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    \"method\": \"create\",\r\n    \"posX\": 35,\r\n    \"posY\": 120,\r\n    \"image\": \"fish2.gif\",\r\n    \"id\": 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis image file must be in the Viper projects `data` folder. Similarly, to place a video clip replace `\"image\": \"fish2.gif\"` with `\"video\": \"your-video-name.mp4\"`. The ID field *must* be set by the client. Any further processing instruction on an already placed image or video will be referred by that media's ID. For example, to invert the image we just placed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  {\r\n    \"id\": 1,\r\n    \"method\": \"update\",\r\n    \"invert\": 1    \r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Authors\r\nThis project is developed by @isha, @joeycarlos, @joh9p and @anupam110191 and is currently active. We would also like to give credit to these open source projects that we have used:\r\n\r\n- [gifAnimation](http://extrapixel.github.io/gif-animation/) by @extrapixel \r\n- [oscp5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/) by Andreas Schlegel\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Viper? Feel free to open an issue on the Github repo and we'll get it sorted out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
